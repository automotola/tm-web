It comes down to showing the graph of entities, the information a node holds for each entity and the data the entities share in edges.

The next step is selecting a sequence of nodes, looking for property groups that match a signal* that has been predefined in a model or context.

1. Create a pointer node
2. Create a property/child node for this pointer from a given model
3. Produce a timeseries record of the changes in weights as time changes (chart)
4. Repeat step 3 and 4 for each property
5. Create a target node
6. Create a peer/sibling edge for this target from a given context
7. Produce a strategy record of the possible changes in properties as context changes (tree)
8. Repeat step 6 and 7 for each peer
9. Create a graph with a target node for each edge in the previous graph
10. Create a corrolation edge with any target node graph with a node for each
10. Repeat 4 for each
