**Mother Earth Network**
- A sensor data network and software, created to enhance our  
environmental health through a community-based approach.  
 
- We call it the: social eco-data network


**Vision**
- We would like to see a world where people create a healthier ecosystem in collaboration with each other and by using the latest technology to maintain and improve their surroundings.


**Product & User**
- We offer two products: 
- The consumer product: a Data collection kit with free Smartphone application.
- The business product: A data analytics platform, Multiple data collection kits, with sensor maintenance service. 

**How does it work**
- We provide our users with sensory equipment and a digital platform with which they can gather data that will help them understand and improve the health of their local ecosystem.

**Unique products/insights**
- Our social eco-data network utilizes machine learning in processing, analyzing and visualizing data, to push the boundaries of environmental improvement.

**Current state**
- “We are leaving the pre-seed stage:  
Working on a prototype and developing proof of concept

What we did to test the concept:

* Create a prototype and test this with users (installations and exhibitions around 800 people)

* Develop a member base (network 100 members)

* Pilot with existing sensors in Zwolle and Utrecht (collaboration with RIVM)

* Expanding our team : scientists and software

* Prototype sensor 3d printing: multiple iterations -> now developing chips

* Creating a design and language– multiple iterations (ready for making)

* Branding strategy went through research fase and is being developed

* Building the platform based on pilot products”
