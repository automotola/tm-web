**Current state**
“We are leaving the pre-seed stage and entering the seed stage"  
Working on a prototype and developing proof of concept

What we did to test the concept:
	* Create a prototype and test this with users (installations and exhibitions around 800 people)
	* Develop a member base (network 100 members)
	* Pilot with existing sensors in Zwolle and Utrecht (collaboration with RIVM)
	* Expanding our team : scientists and software
	* Prototype sensor 3d printing: multiple iterations -> now developing chips
	* Creating a design and language– multiple iterations (ready for making)
	* Branding strategy went through research fase and is being developed
	* Building the platform based on pilot products
